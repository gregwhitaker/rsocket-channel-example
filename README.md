# rsocket-channel-example
An example of sending bi-directional messages between applications with the channel interaction model in [RSocket](http://rsocket.io).

## Building the Example
Run the following command to build the example:

    ./gradlew clean build
    
## Running the Example
Follow the steps below to run the example:

1. Run the following command to start the `number-service`:

        ./gradlew :number-service:run
        
    If the service has started successfully you will see the following in the terminal:
    
        > Task :number-service:run
        [main] INFO example.number.service.NumberService - RSocket server started on port: 7000
        
2. In a new terminal, run the following command to start streaming integers with the `number-client`:

        ./gradlew :number-client:run
        
    If successful, you will see integers being streamed out to the service and the total count of even numbers being streamed
    back in the terminal:
    
        [reactor-tcp-nio-1] INFO example.number.client.NumberClient - Total Even Number Count: 26
        [parallel-8] INFO example.number.client.NumberClient - Sending: 9
        [parallel-1] INFO example.number.client.NumberClient - Sending: 4
        [reactor-tcp-nio-1] INFO example.number.client.NumberClient - Total Even Number Count: 27
        [parallel-2] INFO example.number.client.NumberClient - Sending: 3
        [parallel-3] INFO example.number.client.NumberClient - Sending: 7
        [parallel-3] INFO example.number.client.NumberClient - Done
    
    Once the client has streamed `50` integers it will complete.
